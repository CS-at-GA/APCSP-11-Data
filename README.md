## Pre-reads

* **Required**[^1]: This _Harvard Business Review_ article [Visualizations That Really Work](https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work) is a good overview. If you read articles from HBR frequently, you'll likely run into a paywall. You may be able to use a different browser or private browsing to get around it.
* **Required**, but skimmable: This _Harvard Business School_ overview of different [data visualization techniques](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-visualization-techniques)
* At least one of these three more technical overviews:
  * [What is Data Visualization](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization) (Tableu)
  * [Data Visualization](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-visualization#toc-what-is-da-2LvBeFaU) (IBM)
  * [What is Data Visualization and Why is it Important?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-visualization-and-why-is-it-important/) (GeeksforGeeks)
* Then just take a look at some data visualizations. You could google, or use any of the links below

## Assignment 

You are to find a dataset and create a way to display the information in the data set in various and potentially enlightening ways. 

### Requirements

* your data set must have many entries that have multiple objective properties[^2].
* your data set should be in CSV or JSON format

[^1]: If you can... 
[^2]: the example data set here has 116 entries (rows/lines), each with 10 properties (columns). I'd call it slightly small, but still rich.
